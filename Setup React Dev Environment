2nd Step â€“ Stripping down and Cleaning up your project folders/files

Remove all the unwanted files from the Src Folder
Restructure and Test your project

1.	Src Folder (keep this folder)

  // In this folder, you should only keep this file
  a. Index.js 
  b. You can also create additional folders here. Such as: app folder => which will have all your React Components in a .jsx file
  
  // Remove these references
  -	import './index.css';
  -	import App from './App';
  -	import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';
  -	serviceWorker.unregister();

2.	Public Folder (Keep this folder)
    a.	Index.html

        // Remove the unnecessary references keep only important ones
        -	Important Meta Tags
        -	Title
        -	The main <div> tag
        
    b. Excluding the index.html file, remove all the other files from the folder

3. node_modules (Keep this folder) 

4.	Remove the README.md file

5.	Remember: You can add any additional file to your project within the appropriate folder

6.	Test whether your project is WORKING
    a.	Make sure to delete the following code from the index.js file and add you own
      <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
      </React.StrictMode>
    
    b. Make sure your index.js file looks like the code below:
    
            import React from 'react';
            import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

            const myfirstelement = <h1>Hello React!</h1>
            ReactDOM.render(myfirstelement, document.getElementById('root'));
    
    c. Refresh the page and see whether it is work effectively or run the below code in the terminal
        - npm start
