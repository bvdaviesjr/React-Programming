  // Remove these references
  -	import './index.css';
  -	import App from './App';
  -	import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';
  -	serviceWorker.unregister();

2.	Public Folder (Keep this folder)
    a.	Index.html

    // Remove the unnecessary references keep only important ones
    -	Important Meta Tags
    -	Title
    -	The main <div> tag

3.	Remove the README.md file

4.	Remember: You can add any additional file to your project within the appropriate folder
